# go-chirpy

My **first** server build in Go, specifically for the "Learn Web Servers" course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).
Please refrain from harsh judgement ğŸ™‚.

## Motivation

I wanted to better understand what a server is. The course has definetely presented me with topics I have heard about, but never dealt with before. I had my fair share of pesky problems and failing tests.
